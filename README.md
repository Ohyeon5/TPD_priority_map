# TPD_priority_map
Psychophysics Experiment for discriminating retinotopic or non-retinotopic mapping of priority map using TPD

This code is fully coded by matlab and to run this code, you need Psychotool box and an in-house toolbox: LPSY Toolbox. To get our in-house toolbox, please contact our main author oh-hyeon.choung@epfl.ch.

TPD_PriorityMap_Stim.m file has all the stimuli specifications. TPD_PriorityMap_Run.m is a run file, where you can change the parameters for your own use. 

indv_analysis.m is a brief analysis file for a quick overview of each individual's data. 

All the codes are largely under development, so feel free to contact the author of any reasons!! 

To Run the experimental code:
- From Matlab, move to /PTB folder
- run TPD_PriorityMap_Run.m
